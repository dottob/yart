Basic ray tracer. Currently implements:
**Geometric primitives:
> - Smooth Bezier patches
> - Spheres, cubes, triangles, planes
> - Arbitrary matrix transformations** Light sources:
> - Point, directional
**Shading:
> - Reflections
> - Ambient, diffuse, specular (Phong)** Accelerated intersection testing:
> - Bounding-boxes in a 3D-grid (have to specify manually)
**JPEG output**
